# Emoji Art

## Overview

Emoji Art is a Flask web application that allows users to upload images and convert them into pixelated art made entirely of emojis. The application down-scales the uploaded image, pixelates it, and then maps each pixel to the closest matching emoji based on color.

## Features

- Image Upload: Users can upload image files in common formats (JPG, PNG, etc.).
- Emoji Grid Generation: The application generates a grid of emojis that visually represent the uploaded image.
- Customizable Grid Size: Users can select different resolutions for the emoji grid.

## Installation and Setup
